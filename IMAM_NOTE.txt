Before any modification to the source code is done, be sure to do the following:

1) Either run this 
     source ~/src/nwchem-6.8/NOTES/DEV_SETENV.sh
   or this
     source ~/src/nwchem-6.8/NOTES/KENL_SETENV.sh
   or this
     source ~/src/nwchem-6.8/NOTES/NWXC_SETENV.sh
   This will set the necessary environment variables.
     
2) If this package has been successfully installed before, then jump to step 3) 
   below. On  the other hand, if this is a newly exctracted or downloaded package, 
   then go to the top directory (the one containing src and contrib folders), and 
   run this script
     ./contrib/distro-tools/build_nwchem
   This will create nwchem_make_env.sh file in the top directory.

3) Go to the top directory and run this script file (the one created in step 2)
   above)
     source ~/src/nwchem-6.8/DEV_intel-18.0.0_impi-2018.0.128/nwchem_make_env.sh
   This will enable the command `renwc' to be called from wherever you are inside
   the nwchem source tree.

4) If this package is a newly extracted or downloaded package, then run `renwc'
   from under the src/ folder (i.e. not in its subdirectory). Otherwise, you can
   run it from wherever you like inside the src/ tree. The path of the created
   executable is:
     ~/src/nwchem-6.8/DEV_intel-18.0.0_impi-2018.0.128/bin/LINUX64/nwchem
