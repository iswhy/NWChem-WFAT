General steps to add new inputs for the WFAT module:
  1) In wfat_read_input subroutine, add
        newinp_exist = .false.
        newinp_stat = .false.
  2) Inside the existing do while, add the input parsing lines. See examples there.
  3) Move to the wfat_process_input.F file. Inside the wfat_exist_input subroutine,
     determine what to do when newinp is found or not found from the input file.
     There are three parts to this: (i) existence checks, (2) format checks, and (3)
     necessity checks.
  4) Inside the wfat_sanity_input subroutine, check if the supplied value for newinp
     make sense, e.g. if it has to be positive, integer, etc. See examples there.
  5) Inside the wfat_putrtdb_input subroutine, determine whether to put newinp into
     the RTDB or not based on its necessity determined at step 3) above.
