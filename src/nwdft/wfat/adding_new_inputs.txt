General steps to add new inputs for the WFAT module:

  1) In wfat_read_input subroutine, add
        newinp_exist = .false.
        newinp_stat = .false.

  2) Inside the existing do while, add the input parsing lines. See examples there.

  3) Head over to the wfat_process_input.F file. Inside the wfat_exist_input subroutine,
     determine what to do when newinp is found or not found from the input file.
     There are three parts to this: (i) existence checks, (2) format checks, and (3)
     necessity checks.
     
  4) For the necessity checks, go to wfat_need_input and mewfat_need_input 
     subroutines. In both of these subroutines, add the line
        newinp_need = .false.
     around the same location as the other similar lines (look into these routines).
     
  5) If newinp is needed when OE-WFAT is used, inside wfat_need_input, add the
     following line
        call wfat_need_input0(sr, rt, tmd, tmda, yi, avb, avg, newinp)
     around the same location as the other similar lines (check on these routines).
     Here sr, rt, tmd, tmda, yi, avb, and avg are logical type variables whose
     value depends on whether newinp is needed when sr (structure factor),
     rt (rate), tmd (transverse momentum), tmda (atom-resolved transverse momentum),
     yi (yield), avb (beta-averaged yield), and avg (gamma-averaged yield) are
     requested. On the other hand, if newinp is not needed when OE-WFAT is used,
     do not add the above wfat_need_input0 line. Do the same as above inside
     mewfat_need_input.
     
  6) Inside the wfat_sanity_input subroutine, add a checking mechanism to determine
     if the supplied value for newinp make sense, e.g. if it has to be positive,
     integer, etc. Some utility subroutines exists for this purpose, see examples
     there.
     
  7) Inside the wfat_putrtdb_input subroutine, determine whether to put newinp into
     the RTDB or not based on its necessity determined at step 3) above. In doing
     this, also consider whether to put newinp into RTDB given the start type of the
     job. For example, if newinp is to be added into RTDB only if it is needed and
     the start type is one that starts from scratch (i.e. not restarted), then do
     something like this line
        if (newinp_need .and. os) then
	   l = rtdb_put(rtdb, 'wfat:newinp', mt_dbl, 1, newinp))
	   if (.not. l) call errquit('Error message', 10, UERR)
        endif
     where os is one of the outputs of util_get_rtdb_state routine called at the
     beginning of the wfat_putrtdb_input routine that tells us if it is a start-
     from-scratch job or not.
     
  8) Add the declaration of newinp, newinp_exist, newinp_stat, and newinp_need into
     wfat_input.fh and include them under the wfat_input_var COMMON block. If newinp
     is an optional input, then also add the declaration of the corresponding 
     default value, say def_newinp, inside wfat_input.fh. Make def_newinp a
     parameter.
